## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS variables
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM

### What I learned

1. I learned how to use fetch to display data from an API.

2. I learned how to create a button that reloads the API when clicked.

### Continued development

I would like to continue learning how to use APIs. I also want to learn about event handling so I can handle any errors that may come up when dealing with APIs.
